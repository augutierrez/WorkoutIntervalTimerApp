# WorkoutIntervalTimerApp

This is an app that counts timed intervals (depending on user's time preference).  
It allows you to select how long you want the intervals to be, and everytime it hits the selected time,
it notifies you and adds on to the number of cycles elapsed.  
This app was made with the purpose to aid physical training with time.
